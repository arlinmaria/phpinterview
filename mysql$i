 MySQL Extension:
This is the original extension designed to allow you to develop PHP applications that interact with a MySQL database. The mysql extension provides a procedural interface and is intended for use only with MySQL versions older than 4.1.3. This extension can be used with versions of MySQL 4.1.3 or newer, but not all of the latest MySQL server features will be available.
mysqli Extension:
The mysqli extension, or as it is sometimes known, the MySQL improved extension, was developed to take advantage of new features found in MySQL systems versions 4.1.3 and newer. The mysqli extension is included with PHP versions 5 and later.

The mysqli extension has a number of benefits, the key enhancements over the mysql extension being:

    Object-oriented interface
    Support for Prepared Statements
    Support for Multiple Statements
    Support for Transactions
    Enhanced debugging capabilities
    Embedded server support

So Mysql_connect() basically is the database connector to Mysql whereas Mysqli_connect() is the connector for Mysqli databse
