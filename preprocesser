C Preprocessor directives: Before a C program is compiled in a compiler, source code is processed by a program called preprocessor. This process is called preprocessing.
 Commands used in preprocessor are called preprocessor directives and they begin with “#” symbol.
 
 Preprocessor directives are lines included in a program that being with the character #, which make them different from a typical source code text. 
 They are invoked by the compiler to process some programs before compilation.
